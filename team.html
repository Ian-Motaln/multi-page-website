	<!-- Team member #4 paragraph-->
	<p>Ronald Gerald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is a retired businessman who was one of the co-founders of the Apple Computer Company as a partnership with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Wayne is also noted for being the first person to leave the company.</p>
	<p class="Wayne_question">Why Ron Wayne is not officially was not part of the company?</p>
	<p class="Wayne_answer">Ronald Wayne's stint at Apple did not last very long. After 12 days with the company, on April 12, 1976, Wayne had his name taken off of the contract and sold his 10% stake in Apple back to Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs for a measly $800.</p>
